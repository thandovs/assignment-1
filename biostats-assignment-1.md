# Introduction to Biostatistics

## Assignment 1

This assignment will see you practice some of the fundamental skills you have learned in _git_ and _RMarkdown_. The assignment is not for marks, and you can work in groups. The purpose of the assignment is for you to try your hand at _git_ and _RMarkdown_ with your course instructor present to assist you if you have queries or get stuck. 

### Instructions

1. Create an empty folder (title: assignment-1) on your PortableApps flash-drive.

2. Copy this file ('biostats-assignment-1.md') into the folder.

3. Initialise the repository as a git repository.

4. Open a new project in RStudio (title: assignment-1), and ensure that it is integrated with git.

5. Open a new RMarkdown script using the 'GitHub Document (Markdown)' template.

6. Add a title (Assignment 1) and your name to the YAML header.

7. Add 'biostats-assignment-1.md' and 'assignment-1.Rmd' to be tracked by git.

8. Commit both files.  

9. Using NotePad, create a new file ('README.md') in the 'assignment-1' folder. 
    a. Add the following text to the file:

        > Assignment 1
        >
        > PHSL4005 Introduction to Biostatistics
        >
        > This repository contains files for the first assignment of the course.
        >
        > You can find the gitHub Pages site for the course at the following site.

    b. Make the first line a H2 heading.

    c. Make the second line bold.

    d. Make the term 'GitHub Pages' italic and bold.

    e. Make the word 'site' a hyperlink to the following URL: https://kamermanpr.github.io/PHSL4005-introductory-biostats.git

    f. Add and commit the file.

10. Using NotePad, create a new file (LICENSE.md)in the 'assignment-1' folder.
    a. Add an H2 heading: 'LICENSE' to the file.

    b. Go to https://creativecommons.org/choose/ and create a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license for your content. 

    c. Copy and paste the html code into the LICENSE.md file, and save, add, commit the file.

11. Using NotePad, create a new file called '.gitignore', and add appropriate text to the file to ensure that 'html' files are not tracked by git.

12. Open a new, empty repository on your gitHub account called: 'assignment-1'.

13. Add the remote to your local git repository, and sync the local files with the remote.

14. In 'assignment-1.Rmd':

    a. Update the knitr default chunk options as follows:

        - Figures must be saved to a subfolder of your 'assignment-1â€™ folder called 'figures'.

        - Figure dimensions must be 8" x 8" and centre aligned.

        - Ensure no messages are shown when parsing the file.

    b. Stop the second code chunk ('cars') being displayed in the output file.

    c. Have the plot in the third code chunk ('pressure') be center aligned (without changing the `knitr::optschunk$set()` code in the first chunk).

15. Save, and commit the file.

16. Knit the document, and open the resulting 'assignment-1.md' file in RStudio and preview as html.

17. Add and commit any new files generated by the knitting prosses, and then push the local repository to the remote.

18. Email the lecturer a link to your repository.
