```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path= 'figures/',
                      fig.align = "center",
                      fig.width = 8, 
                      fig.height= 8, 
                      echo= FALSE,

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars, echo= FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo= FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
